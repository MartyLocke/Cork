Corkman is a nonlinear survival horror game. It's scary enough to send chills down your spine.
The main character is a young gentleman named "Flop" who risks his life craving fortune.
During the night, he ventures into the casemates in search for the long lost legendary cork.
Little did he know that damned cork is accursed. The Cork beast protects it. A wretched man, with
a cork instead of the head, welding sharp as a razor axe.
